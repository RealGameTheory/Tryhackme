### Intro
Mobiles are a great entrypoint for an attacker as the victim will be using mobiles phones for most of their day to day tasks.

With mobile devices having the computing power to replace desktops and laptops, they hold a wide range of valuable artefacts, including:

* Call and chat logs
* GPS and navigation data
* Documents and downloads
* Pictures and video
* Browsing history
* WiFi history
* App-specific data

### Challenges With Mobile Device Forensics

**Manufacturer Protections**

Modern mobile have many security protection mechanisms such as full disk and file-based encryption, authentication (PIN/FaceID/Fingerprint, etc) to unlock and data having various states in which it is or isn't readable, for example:
* Before First Unlock (BFU)
* Requiring authentication every time
* Only need to authenticate once
* No authentication needed

There are securtiy mechanisms like :
* Full disk & file-based encryption
* Isolated encryption keys (Something like tpm)
* Secure boot process
* Sandboxing
* Lockout wiping
* Remote wiping

**APTs Meet Mobile Devices :**

* App Store Malware
* Spyware and Surveillance

Example: Pegasus used a combination of "one click" or "zero click" attacks, known as the ["BLASTPASS"](https://citizenlab.ca/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/) exploit chain, requiring the user only to click a URL to place itself within the device.

**Levels of Acquisition**

When we discuss acquisition levels, we refer to the depth and method required to extract data from a device. For example:
* Age of device (i.e. installed OS version, updates, etc.)
* Security mechanisms in place
* Authenticated or unauthenticated access (i.e. locked or unlocked)
* Availability of tooling to the examiner
* Depth of data we wish to retrieve (i.e. deleted data)

**Acquisition Method**

* Manual: Manual acquisition involves manually interacting with the device to gather information, such as scrolling through chat messages or taking pictures with an alternative device. (Minimal access to system logs and databases.)
* Logical: Logical acquisition involves using features of the mobile devices' Operating System (such as APIs, backup features, etc) to extract data.(Partial.)
* File System: File System acquisition involves creating an entire copy of the device's file system.(Substantial.)
* Physical: An entire bit-for-bit image of the device, allowing deleted data to be recovered.(Full (on devices without encryption at rest).)

> It is essential to enable the "airplane" mode on mobile devices. This prevents any modification to data, and in the case of iOS, prevents remote wiping via the "Find My" feature.

For logical acquisition we can use tools like 3uTools, Easeus, and libimobiledevice on the CLI.We use ADB for android

**Special Acquisition method**

* Specialist Utilities: Specialist hardware and software suites are available to specific organisations. For example, Cellebrite UFED is an advanced acquisition and analysis hardware and software suite only accessible to law enforcement, government agencies, and similar organisations. It uses sophisticated techniques to bypass security mechanisms and analyse mobile devices.
* Jailbreaking: Jailbreaking involves exploiting a known vulnerability within the mobile device's Operating System to provide what's known as "root-level" access, allowing complete control over the device. This technique provides unfiltered access to the device but permanently modifies it, so it is not forensically sound.
* Custom Boot Loading: This technique involves getting the mobile device to boot into a temporary, custom Operating System that provides low-level access to the device and bypasses security mechanisms. It differs from others, such as Jailbreaking, as it does not permanently alter the device, making it forensically sound.
* JTAG: JTAG (Joint Test Action Group) was initially used to diagnose circuit board components.
* Brute-forcing: This can be used to brute force the device pin.
* Cloud Extraction: A much more law-based approach, cloud extraction involves submitting legal requests to manufacturers, app developers, etc., to retrieve application-specific information or backups. In most cases, this can be a more fruitful approach to retrieving data rather than bypassing security mechanisms.

### Practical 1:

* Create the case (As Investigator “Analyst”) 
* Add the evidential item using the details in the following table
* Perform data acquisition
* Export the report to retrieve the flag
