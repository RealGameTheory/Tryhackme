### Intro
Mobiles are a great entrypoint for an attacker as the victim will be using mobiles phones for most of their day to day tasks.

With mobile devices having the computing power to replace desktops and laptops, they hold a wide range of valuable artefacts, including:

* Call and chat logs
* GPS and navigation data
* Documents and downloads
* Pictures and video
* Browsing history
* WiFi history
* App-specific data

### Challenges With Mobile Device Forensics

**Manufacturer Protections**

Modern mobile have many security protection mechanisms such as full disk and file-based encryption, authentication (PIN/FaceID/Fingerprint, etc) to unlock and data having various states in which it is or isn't readable, for example:
* Before First Unlock (BFU)
* Requiring authentication every time
* Only need to authenticate once
* No authentication needed

There are securtiy mechanisms like :
* Full disk & file-based encryption
* Isolated encryption keys (Something like tpm)
* Secure boot process
* Sandboxing
* Lockout wiping
* Remote wiping

**APTs Meet Mobile Devices :**

* App Store Malware
* Spyware and Surveillance

Example: Pegasus used a combination of "one click" or "zero click" attacks, known as the ["BLASTPASS"](https://citizenlab.ca/blastpass-nso-group-iphone-zero-click-zero-day-exploit-captured-in-the-wild/) exploit chain, requiring the user only to click a URL to place itself within the device.
